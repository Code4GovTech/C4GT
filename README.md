# C4GT23
The first edition of C4GT  was launched in May 2022, and it saw participation from 346 applicants out of which 13 were chosen. They successfully created 25+ features & wrote 100K lines of code across 9 key projects. 
However, this is the second time it will be held in 2023. 
We have raised the number of participating items this year because we anticipate greater participation from open source contributors.
With an opportunity for an internship and PPO, this will be a great chance to participate. Please follow the additional instructions on the link below for more information.
