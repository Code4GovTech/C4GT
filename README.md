Code for GovTech (C4GT) is India's first dedicated mentoring program aimed at creating a community that can build and contribute to global Digital Public Goods (DPGs). Selected participants will work on live open-source projects focused on solving population-scale governance challenges. Throughout the program, participants will receive 1:1 mentoring from experienced practitioners from Indian GovTech organizations, a stipend of 1 Lakh, and an opportunity to secure a PPI (Pre-Placement Interview) and PPO (Pre-Placement Offer) after the program ends. The coding phase of the program will take place from July to the end of August.
