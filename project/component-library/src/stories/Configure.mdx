    While the DPG builder ecosystem has seen exciting growth, much of it is still fueled by government or philanthropic funding, which can limit product innovation and long-term sustainability. On the flip side, countless open-source contributors from universities, tech communities, and professional networks are ready to jump in and support DPGs but often hit roadblocks like low visibility, limited opportunities, and a lack of mentorship.
    C4GT is here to bridge that gap! We're bringing together organizations—both builders and adopters—with contributors ranging from students to seasoned professionals. Our mission? To foster ongoing collaborations in the open-source community, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of contributions to drive impactful outcomes. Join us in making a difference! 💡✨
