# Human-in-the-Loop Escalation System

## Overview
The escalation system is designed to handle queries that the chatbot cannot resolve. These queries will be routed to human experts.

## Escalation Triggers
1. User dissatisfaction (e.g., "This doesn't help").
2. Repeated unresolved queries.
3. Medical emergencies or complex scenarios.

## Escalation Process
1. **Identify escalation trigger**:
   - User expresses dissatisfaction.
   - Query matches predefined escalation keywords (e.g., "urgent", "emergency").
2. **Log the query**:
   - Save the user's query and chatbot responses.
   - Include a timestamp for reference.
3. **Route to experts**:
   - Forward the query to a designated healthcare professional.
   - Provide context for the query.
4. **Feedback Loop**:
   - Experts provide a resolution.
   - Update chatbot knowledge base if necessary.

## Future Enhancements
- Automate escalation routing to healthcare platforms.
- Integrate chat transcript for expert review.
